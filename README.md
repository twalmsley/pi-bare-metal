This repository was originally cloned from:

    Raspberry-Pi Bare Metal Tutorial
    ================================
    code is at http://www.valvers.com/embedded-linux/raspberry-pi

Now there is virtually none of the original code in here, just a few snippets needed to initialise the stacks and interrupts. Many thanks to the original developer for bootstrapping me into bare metal on the Pi.
